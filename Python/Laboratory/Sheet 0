Installing python


Steps to Install Python on Windows
1. Check if Python is Already Installed
Open Command Prompt.
Type python --version or python3 --version.
If Python is installed, the version number will be displayed. If not, proceed to the next step.
2. Download the Python Installer
Go to the official Python website: python.org/downloads.
Click on the "Download Python" button for the latest version (preferably Python 3).
3. Run the Installer
Locate the downloaded .exe file and double-click it to start the installation.
In the installer window, check the following options:
Add Python to PATH: This allows you to run Python from the command line.
Install for all users: This option requires admin rights.
Click on Install Now to proceed with the default settings.
4. Verify the Installation
After installation, open Command Prompt again.
Type python --version to confirm that Python is installed correctly.
You should see the version number displayed.
5. Install an IDE (Optional)
For coding, consider installing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for a better coding experience.
6. Start Coding
You can now start writing Python code using any text editor or IDE. To run Python scripts, use the command line or the IDE's built-in terminal.
These steps will help you successfully install Python on your Windows system.
